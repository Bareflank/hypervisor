; Note:
;
; To find more information about why RDTSC and RDTSCP are implemented this
; way, please see the following reference:
;
; http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/ia-32-ia-64-benchmark-code-execution-paper.pdf
;
; Also it should be noted that this paper makes a critical mistake with
; RDTSC, complaining of variance. CPUID will introduce some variance, but it
; should not be as drastic as demonstrated in this paper as they forget to
; initialize at a minimum RAX prior to running CPUID which means that they are
; randomly accessing different leaf functions in CPUID introducing variance.
