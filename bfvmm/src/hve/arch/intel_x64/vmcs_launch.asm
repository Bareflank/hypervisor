    ; is being started for the first time (but not always, as is the case
    ; with VMCS migration and sleep/resume). When this happens, xsaves has
    ; not been run on the save area, which means it has not been properly
    ; configured to be used with xrstors (not sure why Intel didn't include
    ; an init instruction for xsave, but this basically emulates it).
