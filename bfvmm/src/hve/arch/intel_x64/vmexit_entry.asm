; VMExit Entry Point
;
; With respect to VT-x, when an exit occurs, the CPU keeps the state of the
; registers from the guest intact, and gives the state of the registers prior
; to vmresume, back to the guest. The only exception to this is RSP and RIP as
; these two registers are specific to the VMM (RIP is vmexit_entry,
; and RSP is the exit_handler_stack). So the only job that this entry point
; has is to preserve the state of the guest
;
