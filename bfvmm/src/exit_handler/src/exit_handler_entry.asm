; VMM Entry Point
;
; The exit handler is the actual VMM. It's the peice of code that sits above
; the guest OS, and monitors what it's doing, and based on the different types
; of exit conditions, changes the guest's operations to suit it's needs.
;
; With respect to VT-x, when the exit occurs, the CPU keeps the state of the
; registers from the guest intact, and gives the state of the registers prior
; to vmresume, back to the guest. The only exception to this is RSP and RIP as
; these two registers are specific to the VMM (RIP is exit_handler_entry,
; and RSP is the exit_handler_stack). So the only job that this entry point
; has is to preserve the state of the guest, and restore the state of the
; guest. Note that the guest's registers are globally defined, which means that
; the exit handler has the ability to modify these registers if needed, which
; is likely to occur.

; VMM Guest Instructions
;
; Certain instructions are better optimized, if they have direct access to the
; guest state. The exit handler can use the information that is stored in the
; resulting guest state as needed, or it can choose to pass on the resulting
; state back to the guest. These functions provide these optimized instructions
;
; Note that some of these instructions only modify the first 32 bits of the
; registers. Since we do not know what ABI will be running as it could be
; System V or MS x64, we cannot assume what state the upper bits of these
; registers should be left in. For this reason, when we execute these
; instructions, we first load the guest state into the register, and then allow
; the instruction to execute as expected, and then save the result, thus
; preserving the upper bits of each register that would be affected by the
; instruction. It's still possible for the exit handler to modify from there
; as needed, but at least the starting point of the instruction is preserving
; the state of the guest
