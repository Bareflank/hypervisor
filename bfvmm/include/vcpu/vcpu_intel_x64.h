/// Virtual CPU (Intel x86_64)
///
/// The Virtual CPU represents a "CPU" to the hypervisor that is specific to
/// Intel x86_64. Each core in a multi-core system has a vCPU associated with
/// it. Each guest VM must also have a vCPU for each physical CPU on the
/// system, which means that the total number of vCPUs being managed by the
/// vcpu_manager is
///
/// @code
/// #cores + (#cores * #guests)
/// @endcode
///
/// This Intel specific vCPU class provides all of the functionality of the
/// base vCPU, but also adds classes specific to Intel's VT-x including the
/// vmxon_intel_x64, vmcs_intel_x64, exit_handler_intel_x64 and
/// intrinsics_intel_x64 classes.
///
/// Note that these should not be created directly, but instead should be
/// created by the vcpu_manager, which uses the vcpu_factory to actually
/// create a vcpu.
