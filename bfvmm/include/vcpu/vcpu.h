/// Virtual CPU
///
/// The vCPU represents a "core" for a machine.
///
/// For the host VM (the VM that starts the hypervisor), 1 vCPU must exist
/// for each physical core. These vCPUs are special. Their IDs are their
/// physical core nums as assigned by the host OS. This is because the "guest"
/// part of the ID is 0. The resources these vCPUs are given should match
/// the resources the host OS is using. Whether this is a type 1 or type 2
/// configuration, the host OS is usually the OS that is already running when
/// the hypervisor is loaded. In a type 1 configuration, this is UEFI, which
/// will later boot another OS (e.g. Windows, Linux or macOS) after the
/// hypervisor is loaded. In a type 2 configuration, the host OS is the
/// OS that is already running. Keep in mind that this is typically how it's
/// done, but doesn't have to be the case. For example, in an embedded case,
/// it might make sense to start from UEFI, and boot a separate control and
/// hardware VM and never execute the UEFI instance ever again. Just
/// depends on what your looking for. The goal here is to create a vCPU
/// architecture that can support any configuration your looking for.
///
/// For a guest VM, there can be any number of vCPUs. The first half of the
/// ID is the guest ID, and the second half of the ID is a unique identifier.
/// The goal with Bareflank is to allow any number of cores, regardless
/// of the physical core configuration. To support this, vCPUs
/// can be scheduled on any core, and the ID does not correlate with
/// a physical core. It's up to the vCPU implementation to figure out how to
/// schedule a core on the proper vCPU.
///
/// This generic vCPU class not only provides the base class that architecture
/// specific vCPUs will be created from, but it also provides some of the base
/// functionality that is common between all vCPUs.
///
/// The init, fini, run and hlt functions must be executed in the proper
/// order. Each vCPU must be initialized and finalized. The destructor for
/// the vCPU should not be used as destructors are labeled "noexcept" by
/// default. Instead the init and fini functions act as constructors /
/// destructors that can handle errors if they should arise.
///
/// Note that these should not be created directly, but instead should be
/// created by the vcpu_manager, which uses the vcpu_factory to actually
/// create a vcpu. The vcpu_factory is provided by default, but should be
/// overloaded by a Bareflank extension to provide custom logic on how to
/// implement the hypervisor itself. It's in this function, that host-only,
/// type 1 and type 2 hypervisors can be defined (including guest support).
/// Also note that the vCPU is a base class. The vcpu_factory really should
/// be creating architectural vCPUs as this class doesn't do much.
