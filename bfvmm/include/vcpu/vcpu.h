/// Virtual CPU
///
/// The Virtual CPU represents a "CPU" to the hypervisor. Each core in a
/// multi-core system has a vCPU associated with it. Each guest VM must also
/// have a vCPU for each physical CPU on the system, which means that the
/// total number of vCPUs being managed by the vcpu_manager is
///
/// @code
/// #cores + (#cores * #guests)
/// @endcode
///
/// This generic vCPU class not only provides the base class that architecture
/// specific vCPUs will be created from, but it also provides some of the base
/// functionality that is common between all vCPUs. For example, all vCPUs
/// have an "id" and a debug_ring.
///
/// Note that these should not be created directly, but instead should be
/// created by the vcpu_manager, which uses the vcpu_factory to actually
/// create a vcpu.
