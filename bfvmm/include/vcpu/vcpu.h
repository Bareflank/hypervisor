/// Virtual CPU
///
/// The vCPU represents a "core" for a virtual machine. There are different
/// types of virtual machines (the host VM and guest VM being good examples)
/// but in either case, a set of vCPUs must be provided.
///
/// For the host VM (also called the hardware domain), 1 vCPU must exist
/// for each physical core. These vCPUs are special. Their IDs are their
/// physical core #s as assigned by the host OS. This is because the "guest"
/// port of the ID is 0. The resources these vCPUs are given should match
/// the resources the host OS is using.
///
/// For a guest VM, there can be any number of vCPUs. The first half of the
/// ID is the guest ID, and the second half of the ID is a unique identifier.
/// Since a vCPU can be scheduled on any core, the ID does not correlate with
/// a physical core.
///
/// This generic vCPU class not only provides the base class that architecture
/// specific vCPUs will be created from, but it also provides some of the base
/// functionality that is common between all vCPUs. For example, all vCPUs
/// have an ID and a debug_ring.
///
/// Note that these should not be created directly, but instead should be
/// created by the vcpu_manager, which uses the vcpu_factory to actually
/// create a vcpu.
