/// vCPU Factory
///
/// This class is used by the vcpu_manager to create vCPUs. Specifically,
/// this class provides a seem that allows users of Bareflank to replace the
/// default vCPU with their own, custom vCPUs that extend the functionality
/// of Bareflank above and beyond what is already provided. This seems also
/// provides a means to unit test the vcpu_manager.
///
/// To provide custom logic, define your own make_vcpu function, in your
/// own vcpu_factory module, and load your module instead of the module that
/// is provided by Bareflank. For an example of how to do this, please
/// see:
