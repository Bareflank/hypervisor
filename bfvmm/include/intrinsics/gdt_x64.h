/// Global Descriptor Table
///
/// This class provides an abstraction around the global descriptor table
/// for 64bit.
///
/// This class does not provide a "descriptor" class as the amount of code
/// needed to completely abstract each descriptor type would be enormous
/// for something that is setup once, and never touched again. So it is
/// left to the user to understand how to set the access rights for each
/// descriptor manually, as this is the part that is descriptor specific.
/// In general, all of the information about each descriptor can be found
/// in the Intel Manual in Volume 3.
///
/// Generally speaking, there are 2 different types of descriptors, a
/// code/data segment descriptor, and a TSS descriptor.
///
/// A code/data segment descriptor is a descriptor that is loaded into
/// es, cs, ss, ds, fs or gs. Information about these types of descriptors
/// can be found in Volume 3, section 3.4.5. A code segment is any
/// segment that is loaded into CS. Although not called out in all of the
/// documentation, Intel does have a stack segment which is any descriptor
/// loaded into SS, and the access rights are different for a stack segment.
/// Finally there are data segments which are any descriptor loaded into
/// es, ds, fs and gs. On 64bit, es and ds are not available, so they should
/// always point to the NULL descriptor, which is the first descriptor in the
/// table, which has to be set to all 0s (per the spec). The only parts of
/// cs, ss, fs, and gs that are used are the access rights. The CPU in
/// 64bit mode assumes that the base is set to 0, and the limit is 0xFFFFF.
/// Although the limit is only 4G (because it's only 20 bits), the CPU
/// internally sets the limit to 2^64 for you. fs and gs are the only segments
/// that can have a base address not set to 0, but they cannot be set using
/// the GDT, and instead have to be set using the MSRs. Bareflank uses
/// gs to store the offset into the state save area for the exit handler.
///
/// A TSS descriptor defines the task state segment. This is a structure
/// that is defined 7.2 (for 32bit), and 7.7 (for 64bit). The OS might
/// fill in this structure for syscalls, but in general, this structure
/// is not used in 64bit, but still needs to be defined. For a hypervisor,
/// this structure can be left blank. The base address of the TSS descriptor
/// needs to be the address of the TSS, the limit should be sizeof(TSS), which
/// for a hypervisor that doesn't use the IO bitmap, or any custom data is
/// 104 bytes, and the access rights are set to a present 64bit TSS. There
/// is one complication with the TSS descriptor which is that you cannot
/// simply call ltr (load task register) with any TSS. The TSS cannot have
/// the busy flags set. Since there is a TSS that the host OS has, and a
/// TSS for the VMM, this tends to be fine, up to the point where the
/// VMM attempts to promote the guest. When this happens, there are actually
/// two TSS descriptors marked as busy, which should never happen, but does.
/// The solution is to mark the host OS's TSS descriptor as not busy
/// manually before loading it.
