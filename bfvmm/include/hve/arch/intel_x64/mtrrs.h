/// MTRRs
///
/// There are two types of ranges that MTRRs specify: fixed and variable.
/// The first 1MB of physical memory is specified by the 11 fixed-range MTRRs
/// (i.e. 11 MSRs), with each MTRR divided into eight, 1-byte sub-ranges:
///
/// [0x00000, 0x7FFFF] (1 MSR * 8 sub-ranges * 64KB each == 512KB)
/// [0x80000, 0xBFFFF] (2 MSR * 8 sub-ranges * 16KB each == 256KB)
/// [0xC0000, 0xFFFFF] (8 MSR * 8 sub-ranges * 4KB  each == 256KB)
///
/// The number of variable ranges is IA32_MTRRCAP[7:0], and each range
/// is specified with two MSRs; one that describes the base and memory type,
/// and another that helps determine the range size.
///
/// This class reads the MTRRs and produces a list of MTRRs that can be
/// processed by the user. It should be noted that the list of MTRRs does not
/// match what is in the MSRs, but instead provides a corrected version that
/// is continuous and non-overlapping.
