/// Basic Object Allocator
///
/// The goals of this allocator includes:
/// - O(1) allocation time
/// - O(1) deallocation time
/// - No external fragmentation (internal fragmentation is allowed, and can
///   be high depending on the size of the object)
/// - Pre-allocate backing store, or dynamically allocate backing store as
///   needed (depends on usage)
/// - All external allocations made by the object allocator are a page in size
///
/// To support these features, this allocator uses 4 different stacks.
/// - page stack: this stack stores a pool of page_t structures, each page_t
///   stores the address of a single page that can be used as a backing store
///   for allocations. Each page_stack_t can store 255 page_t structures before
///   anther page_stack_t has to be pushed to the stack
/// - object stack: this stack stores all of the object_t structures. Each
///   object_stack_t can store 255 object_t structures before another
///   object_stack_t has to be pushed to the stack. Each object_t stores an
///   address within a page_t's allocated page, in other words, the object_t
///   struct actually stores the memory that is given out by the allocator.
/// - free / used stacks: these stacks store the object_t structures based
///   on their current status. object_t structures ready to be allocated are
///   stored on the free stack, while object_t structures already allocated
///   are stored on the used stack. Each allocation / deallocation simply
///   moves a object_t structure from one stack to another.
///
/// In order to support both dynamic allocation, and limited pre-allocation
/// schemes (i.e. all memory is allocated ahead of time, and once this
/// pre-allocated memory is used, the allocator is out of memory), a max_pages
/// variable is defined. If set to 0, the max number of pages used by the
/// allocator is unlimited, and all allocations are performed dynamically
/// on demand. If set to > 0, all memory is pre-allocated and limited. Also
/// note that the max_pages refers to the total number of pages allocated for
/// use by the page pool, and does not include pages allocated for the
/// allocator's internal stacks.
///
/// Windows:
/// A note about MSVC's implementation of the STL containers. Windows assumes
/// the allocators are not stateful (this is a stateful allocator). Since
/// Windows doesn't adhere to the C++11 spec, it assumes allocators of the
/// same type can deallocate even if they are not equal. As a result,
/// containers like std::list allocate without deallocating, and then attempt
/// to deallocate with a new allocator at a later time. For this reason, the
/// destructor does not cleanup memory if the allocator is still holding onto
/// objects in the used list. This object allocator should not be used with
/// Windows MSVC as a result as it will leak memory.
///
/// Limitations:
/// - The largest allocation that can take place is a page. Any
///   allocation larger than this should use the buddy allocator
/// - To achieve O(1) deallocation times, deallocation does not check the
///   validity of the provided pointer. If the pointer provided was not
///   previously allocated using the same allocator, corruption is likely.
///
/// TODO:
/// - For this allocator to be used by the SLAB allocator, the SLAB will have
///   to know what the size of the allocation was based on the address alone.
///   To overcome this issue, the maximum allocation should be a page - 64
///   bytes. The last 64 bytes should be used to store the size of the
///   allocations in that page, plus some reserved bytes for future use.
///   This way, the SLAB can mask off the address to calculate the location of
///   the size of this object without having to do a lookup. The size function
///   should be implemented as a static function that can get the size of an
///   object given any address (likely unsafe, but effective).
///
/// Performance Notes:
/// - Like most allocators, if the object size is small, the overhead of
///   managing this memory is large and vice versa. That being said,
///   the internal fragmentation seen by this allocator is smaller than that
///   of GCC's allocator. Plus, this allocator only allocates a page at a time
///   which means all allocations are aligned, and better suited to pair with
///   a buddy allocator than the default implementation.
/// - When compared to GCC's default allocators for std::list, this allocator
///   outperforms with respect to both allocations, and deallocations with both
///   the limited and unlimited versions. Note that the unit tests use a
///   std::map to ensure memory is not leaked, resulting in additional overhead
///   not seen by the default allocators. A traditional malloc / free version
///   is provided that can be uncommented if needed. Note that GCC's
///   implementation does have a different set of goals including thread-safety.
/// - When compared to Windows, this allocator is significantly better than
///   the default implementation. It should be noted that Windows leaks
///   memory.
