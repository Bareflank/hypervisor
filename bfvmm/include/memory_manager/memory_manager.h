/// The memory manager has two specific functions:
/// - malloc / free memory
/// - virt_to_phys / phys_to_virt conversions
///
/// To support malloc / free, the memory manager has a buffer that is
/// created at compile time that is can pull from and provide to the rest
/// of the VMM. If the memory manager runs out of memory, the system is
/// halted. To increase memory, adjust the number of blocks that are reserved
/// in constants.h.
///
/// To support virt / phys mappings, the memory manager has an add_mdl
/// function that is called by the driver entry. Each time the driver entry
/// allocates memory for an ELF module, it must call add_mdl with a list of
/// page mappings that tells the VMM how to convert from virt to phys and back.
/// The memory manager uses this information to provide the VMM with the needed
/// conversions.
///
/// Finally, this module also provides the libc functions that are needed by
/// libc++ for new / delete. For this reason, this modules is required to get
/// libc++ working, which is needed by, pretty much the rest of the VMM
/// including the serial code. Therefore, if there is issues with the
/// memory mamaner, the process of debugging the memory manager is not simple,
/// as you must get rid of all of the other modules, and work with the
/// memory manager directly until it's working as needed (i.e. why unit
/// testing can be very helpful here).
