    ///     Extensions can use this to store data specific to a PP as needed.
    ///     The tls_t can also be used during unit testing to store testing
    ///     specific logic and data to ensure tests can support constexpr
    ///     style unit testing. Also note that this is stored in the arch
    ///     specific folders as it usually needs to store arch specific
    ///     resources. In this simple example, we leave this empty.

    /// <!-- notes -->
    ///   @note IMPORTANT: Extensions are limited to a single 4k page for the
    ///     TLS data. Technically, extensions are given 2 4k pages, but one of
    ///     the pages is dedicated to TLS data defined by the specification
    ///     and populated by the microkernel (e.g., the general purpose
    ///     registers and ID information). For this reason, if more than a
    ///     page is needed, the TLS block should store pointers to memory that
    ///     is allocated.
