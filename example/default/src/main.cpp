    /// NOTE:
    /// - This is where we store all of our global and thread local variables.
    ///   All of the variables are marked as static to ensure they are not
    ///   visable to the rest of the code.
    /// - All global and thread local variables must be passed around from
    ///   function to function as needed. This ensures that constexpr unit
    ///   tests work properly as the rest of the code never relies on global
    ///   variables. In addition, it dramatically simplifies unit testing, so
    ///   enforcing this coding style, although annoying for the function
    ///   signatures, makes working with the rest of the code a lot easier.
    /// - We use constinit here, which works around a specific AUTOSAR rule
    ///   that does not allow global constructors/destructors. By using
    ///   constinit, we are sure that runtime global constructors are not used.
    ///   Bareflank does not attempt to run any init/fini sections of the
    ///   ELF binary, so if you use accidentally forget constinit, the code
    ///   will likely not execute and fail as a reminder. Instead, use the
    ///   initialization/release pattern that this example provides.
    /// - From a unit testing point of view, each of these will have dummy
    ///   versions that are used for testing. When the code is compiled, each
    ///   source file and head file is compiled in isolation, meaning they are
    ///   not given include folder access to all of the code. This means that
    ///   each of these must be mocked, and the unit tests are given include
    ///   access to the MOCK. This prevents the need for templates, and
    ///   instead, all mock injection is done using the build system, greatly
    ///   simplifying both the code and branch analysis during unit tests as
    ///   the removal of templates also removes issues with branches being
    ///   counted for each instantiaion of a template type.
    /// - Finally, some of these are not really needed for this simple example,
    ///   but we added them for completness so that it is easier to get
    ///   started with your own extension as more complicated code will likely
    ///   need most of these if not all.
