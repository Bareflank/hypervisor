struct _Unwind_Exception;

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Overview
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The IA64 C++ ABI specification describes a set of functions that are used
// to perform stack unwinding for exception support. This implementation uses
// the following documentation:
//
// http://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html#cxx-abi
//
// Also note that this information can also be found in the System V 64bit
// ABI specification:
//
// http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf
//

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1.1 Exception Handler Framework
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The exception framework can be broken up into three layers:
//
// - Layer 3: Defines the language specific keywords for exception support.
//   In C++, this is the "throw" and "catch" keywords that the programmer
//   is actually using.
//
// - Layer 2: The compiler, using the layer 3 keywords, will automatically
//   generate calls to layer 2 functions. These functions are provided by the
//   ABI (for GCC this is libsupc++, and for LLVM, this is libcxxabi). These
//   functions include __cxa_throw, __cxa_catch_begin, etc... These ABIs also
//   provide the "personality" function that is used to determine which catch
//   blocks we should stop unwinding to.
//
// - Layer 3: This layer defines the actual unwinding code. Layer two is an ABI
//   specific abstraction layer, but layer 3 is actually performing the
//   unwinding. This layer is usually provided by the compiler, as it is
//   architecture specific. The problem with most implementations is, they
//   require user space code to work. This one does not. The code defined here
//   belongs to this layer

/// _Unwind_Reason_Code
///
/// The "reason code" is an enum that is used by the following functions:
///
/// - _Unwind_Exception_Cleanup_Fn
/// - _Unwind_RaiseException
/// - _Unwind_Stop_Fn
/// - _Unwind_ForcedUnwind
/// - __personality_routine
///

/// callback functions what to do, so view it as nothing more than a global

/// _Unwind_Exception_Cleanup_Fn
///
/// This function is used delete the _Unwind_Exception. Basically, the
/// _Unwind_Exception structure is made up of two parts, the level I part,
/// and the level II part. Since the structure can be larger
/// than what is defined by this spec (i.e. could contain a level II part),
/// the language needs to provide the deleter. The following defines the
/// acceptable reasons:
///
/// - _URC_FOREIGN_EXCEPTION_CAUGHT: This indicates that a different runtime
///     caught this exception. Nested foreign exceptions, or rethrowing a
///     foreign exception, result in undefined behavior
///
/// - _URC_FATAL_PHASE1_ERROR: The personality routine encountered an error
///     during phase 1
///
/// - _URC_FATAL_PHASE2_ERROR: The personality routine encountered an error
///     during phase 2
///
/// @param reason the reason for deleting exc
/// @param exc the _Unwind_Exception to delete

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1.3 Throwing an Exception
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Throwing an exception can be done with two different functions:
// - _Unwind_RaiseException
// - _Unwind_Resume
//
// These functions are basically identical. They both get the current register
// state, and then unwind the stack until the personality function says to stop.
// The difference is, _Unwind_RaiseException is executed in two phases, a
// search phase and a cleanup phase, while _Unwind_Resume only performs the
// cleanup phase.
//
// It should be noted that if code contains RAII and has to preform cleanup,
// it's likely the _Unwind_RaiseException will be told to jump into the code,
// as if the "catch" block was identified, even though it wasn't the compiler
// will throw again by calling _Unwind_Resume. This code really doesn't
// know the difference between a real "throw, rethrow, catch" and a "throw,
// cleanup, catch" as they look identical
//

extern "C" void
_Unwind_Resume(_Unwind_Exception *exception_object);

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1.4 Exception Object Management
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The exception object is created by layer 2, and contains more information
// than what is visible in layer 3, so layer 2 has to provide the delete
// function, which is located in the exception object itself.
//

extern "C" void
_Unwind_DeleteException(_Unwind_Exception *exception_object);

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1.5 Context Management
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// These functions are basically just wrappers around the functionality that
// we store in the context. For example, layer 2 needs to be able to to set
// and get registers (both general purpose registers as well as the
// instruction pointer). Layer 2, which has the personality function, will also
// need to know where the LSDA is, so that it can use this information to
// find each catch block (view the LSDA as nothing more than a giant list
// of C++ typeinfo blocks, that can be used in giant switch statement). Layer
// 2 also need to know where the start of the FDE is (i.e. pc_begin)
//

// 1.6 Personality Routine
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The personality routine is called by this code, and it tells us when to stop
// looking for a catch block. It uses information in the LSDA to determine if
// a catch block is in the current CFA. Layer 3 has to search in two phases.
// The first phase tells the personality function just to tell us when to stop.
// The second phase does the actual cleanup and then stops. Note that if a
// custom personality function was created, you could reduce this to a single
// cleanup phase, as the initial search phase is a not needed in most cases.
//
// Also note that since this is only meant to be used by C++, we don't need
// the force unwind functionality
//
