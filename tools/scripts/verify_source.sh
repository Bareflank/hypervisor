# Note:
#
# To use this script, you need to create a compilation database, which
# can be done by installing bear on your system, and running make with
# bear:
#
#   STATIC_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true bear make
#
# Once you have compiled Bareflank and created a compilation database,
# you should be able to run this script which will tell you if there are
# any issues with the code. The following describes what we turned off
# and why:
#
# - CastToStruct: Currently, this is only disabled in the ELF loader as
#   the spec requires us to do this. For all other code this is enabled.
#
# - UnreachableCode: we disable this because it seems to output buggy
#   results. For some reason, anything with a try catch block, this seems
#   to get triggered. Furthermore, its not really needed since Coveralls tells
#   us if code cannot be reached, which is also evidence this check is not
#   working right, as it has a lot of false positives.
#
# - misc-noexcept-move-constructor: Like the above, this is known to be
#   buggy which is a shame because it's useful. Basically, if a move
#   constructor is set to "= default" this check fires even if noexcept is
#   provided (at least with 3.8)
#
# - reinterpret-cast: There are legit cases where we need reinterpret_cast.
#   As a result, we have disabled this. That being said, each instance were
#   it is used has been reviewed, and determined to be needed. The remaining
#   instances were removed in place of safer code.
#
# - braces-around-statements: Simply disagree with this one, and has
#   actually been proposed and declined for the C++ Core Guidelines. Instead,
#   analysis tools should detect incorrect indentation when these types
#   of errors occur.
#
# - cert-err60-cpp: This not only triggers an issue with Hippomocks, but is
#   also triggering on std::run_time and std::logic_error on Travis CI,
#   so we have it turned off where needed.
#
# - bounds-pointer-arithmetic
# - bounds-constant-array-index
# - bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#
#   We disabled the above only for the unwinder, and this is because the
#   unwinder needs to be implemented without using C++ librarys, which
#   includes the GSL, so there is no easy way to avoid these errors. Someday
#   we could implement a portion of the GSL inside the unwinder itself and
#   place it in the GSL namespace. This would provide the checks they are
#   looking for and please the linter, but for now these are simply disabled.
#   It should be noted that under the hood, glibc is not using C++ so the
#   code has the same issues.
#
# - modernize-pass-by-value: Also only turned off by the unwinder, this is
#   a performance issue that cannot be addressed because it requires the STL
#   which we cannot use in the unwinder.
#
# Additional Note:
#
# Currently we have -Wcast-align disabled for C as clang-tidy does not have
# a way to turn this off and it complains about the ELF loader. This means
# that right now, we only support archiectures with byte alignment.
