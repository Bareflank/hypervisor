/// Register State
///
/// Defines the state of the registers. When the unwinder first starts, it will
/// get the state of the registers as its first operation. From that point
/// it will locate the FDE associated with the instruction pointer, and unwind
/// the stack. The process of unwinding the stack is to change the register
/// state stored here, which at a minimum changes the instruction pointer and
/// the stack register (but likely also changes other registers). From there
/// the next FDE is located, and the process repeats until the personality
/// function says when to stop
///
/// Once the "catch" block is found, the register state can be used to resume
/// into a new CFA by loading the register state.
