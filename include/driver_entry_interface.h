 * Driver Entry State Machine
 *

 *  driver entry is unloaded, it means that the VMM has not been placed in
 *  memory. The loaded state means that the VMM is in memory, and relocated.
 *  In this state, symbol lookups are possible, and thus things like the VMM
 *  dump comand work. The running state means that the VMM is actually running.
 *  The goal of the state machine is to ensure that the driver keeps track of
 *  the state of the VMM, and handles its transition properly.
