- Kernels that have CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW enabled will kernel oops when
  do_IRQ is called because Bareflank uses it's own stack, and this triggers
  the oops as stack_overflow_check thinks the stack has been overrun. The
  oops can be safely ignored, but the best solution at the moment is to
  disable this check from executing or don't use a kernrel with this enabled.
  This is seen on Fedora as installing the kernel source enables a debug kernel
  by default with this enabled.
