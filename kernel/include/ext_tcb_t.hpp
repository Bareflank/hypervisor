    ///   @brief A thread is a PP, meaning each PP represents a thread. Each
    ///     extension is given two pages of TLS storage per thread. The first
    ///     page contains the TLS data, which is created by thread_local.
    ///     This is just a page that is allocated, so we don't add it here.
    ///     After the TLS data, the ELF TLS spec requires us to define "tp".
    ///     This is a pointer to itself and is used by the asm code the compiler
    ///     generates for thread_local. The rest of the space we can use for
    ///     whatever we want. Currently, we use this for variables defined in
    ///     the ABI. For example, we store the general purpose registers and
    ///     ID information here so that the extension can quickly get access
    ///     to this information.
