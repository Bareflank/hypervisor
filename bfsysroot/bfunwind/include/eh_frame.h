// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Overview
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Exception Handling Framework (eh_frame) is based on the DWARF specification.
// This implementation uses the DWARF 4 specification, but the actual format
// is defined here (as there are some differences):
//
// https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic.pdf
//
// In addition to the above specification, Ian Lance Taylor has a great
// explanation of this section on his blog:
//
// http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/460
// http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/462
// http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/464
//
// and there is another good explanation of this information here:
//
// http://www.deadp0rk.com/2013/09/22/base_abi/
//
// Notes:
//
// - This implementation is not optimized for performance. Exception handling
//   in bareflank should not be used for flow control, but rather for error
//   handling (which should not happen often)
//
// - The specification is written for 32bit and 64bit. This implementation
//   only supports 64bit.
//
// - readelf can be used to parse the .eh_frame section, and provide all of
//   the information that this code should be capable of parsing. Use the
//   --debug-dump=frames flag with a binary or shared module.
//
// - If you see a function that takes a char **addr, it will use the addr and
//   then advance the addr based on the operation performed. This is because
//   the way this spec is written, decoding everything is done in a linear
//   fashion, and each operation is compressed, so you don't know how much to
//   advance the pointer until you decode the operation.
//
// In addition to this implementation, there are two other implementations that
// could provide useful information:
//

// DWARF Extensions (section 10.5)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The Exception Handler Framework in our version of the LSB uses the DWARF 4
// spec, but does so by applying the following extensions
//

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DWARF Exception Header Encoding (section 10.5.1)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// An EH encoding is a byte, with the lower 4 bits describing the format of the
// pointer, and the upper 4 bits describing how the pointer should be applied.
//

// Data Format
#define DW_EH_PE_absptr     0x00
#define DW_EH_PE_uleb128    0x01

#define DW_EH_PE_sdata4     0x0B
#define DW_EH_PE_sdata8     0x0C

/// Decode Pointer
///
/// Decodes a pointer located at addr, given the provided encoding scheme.
/// The whole reason this function exists is that for most pointers in an
/// executable, not all of the address bits are needed. For example, on a 64bit
/// system, most executables are well under 1GB, and thus, the vast majority
/// of address bits are not needed to relay an address. To save space, pointers
/// are encoded, and this function provides the decoding logic.
///
/// Note that for 64bit, you are only likely to PC relative addressing. This
/// is because in 64bit, all of the code is relocatable.
///
/// @param addr the location of the encoded pointer. Note that this takes a
///     double pointer. This is because the total size of the pointer is
///     not know until it is decoded. Therefore, this function not only decodes
///     but it also advances the address based on the size of the pointer.
/// @param encoding the scheme by which the pointer is encoded.
/// @return the resulting pointer
///
uint64_t decode_pointer(char **addr, uint64_t encoding);

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DWARF Call Frame Instruction (CFI) Extensions (section 10.5.2)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// These extend the call frame instructions that are defined in the DWARF 4
// specification.
//

#define DW_CFA_GNU_args_size                    0x2E
#define DW_CFA_GNU_negative_offset_extended     0x2F

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// .eh_frame Section (section 10.6.1)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The .eh_frame section is located in each compiled unit (binary or shared
// module). It contains one or more Call Frame Information structures (not
// to be confusd with the Call Frame Instructions which are defined in the
// DWARF portion of this code). The CFI structures have the following format:
//
//          CFI
// ---------------------
// - CIE               -
// - FDE               -
// - FDE               -
// ---------------------
// - CIE               -
// - FDE               -
// - ...               -
// ---------------------
//
// The size of the .eh_frame section dictates the number of CIEs in the CFI,
// which means that both the starting address of the .eh_frame section, and
// it's size must be available. The best way to view the difference between
// the CIE and the FDE is, the FDE contains the information needed to unwind
// the stack for a given program counter (PC), and the CIE contains the
// information for an FDE that just do happens to be shared with other FDEs.
// For this reason, when looking for the FDE associated with your PC, you
// basically scan looking for FDEs, and just ignore an entry if it happens to
// be a CIE instead of an FDE. Once you find the FDE you care about, you can
// use the CIE offset stored in the FDE to find the CIE associated with that
// FDE. It probably would have made sense for GCC to place the all of the CIEs
// at the end of the list to make scanning easier, but that's not the case.
//
// Both the CIE and the FDE's have some fields that are encoded using both
// signed and unsigned LEB128 format. What this means is the value could be
// 8bits, or even 64bits, it all depends on how many bits are needed to encode
// the value, which provides a means to compress the information in each CIE
// and FDE. For example, a length field my contain the value 0x40, which only
// takes up a byte. The length could also be 0x4000000. The problem is, in a
// lot of cases, len might end up being small most of the time, but because
// it could be larger, 64bits would need to be allocated every time. To
// prevent this, LEB128 breaks up the number in a way that allows it to be
// encoded in a compressed form, thus taking up less space. In our code, when
// you see a LEB128, we store the decoded values as 64bits. There is a really
// good explanation of this here:
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128

/// Exception Header Framework
///
/// This is a pretty simple class. The entire .eh_frame ELF section exists
/// to provide a list of FDEs that describe a specific call frame for
/// unwinding. This class provides a means to lookup an FDE for any PC that
/// the code might be executing from.

/// not include the length field (the payload), as well as some other
