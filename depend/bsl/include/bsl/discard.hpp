    ///   @brief This function discards a parameter that it is given. This is
    ///     the same as executing a static cast. The reason this exists is
    ///     it better documents the intent to discard the result of a function
    ///     or an intentionally unused parameter. This function also exists
    ///     because in some cases, we must pass the address of a discard as
    ///     as a template parameter, which cannot be done with a static cast.
    ///   @include example_discard_overview.hpp
    ///
    ///   SUPPRESSION: PRQA 4050 - exception required
    ///   - We suppress this because M0-1-8 states that all functions marked
    ///     as returning void must have external side effects, which this
    ///     function does not. AUTOSAR allows the use of static_cast<void>
    ///     to mark a parameter or return as unused which is all that this
    ///     is doing in a less verbose, more self-documenting way.
